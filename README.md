## Welcome to my academic **workbook** — a carefully curated archive of assignments, lab work, and late-night survival code.

This repository exists for three reasons:
1. Submitting assignments  
2. Revising before deadlines  
3. Letting future-me question my life choices

## 🔧 Contributions & Pull Requests

This repository is primarily a personal academic workbook.

- Pull requests are **welcome only from peers** who understand the context  
- Only **useful, relevant improvements** will be considered  
- Do **not** dump formatting changes, random refactors, or “just testing” commits  

If a change doesn’t:
- improve clarity  
- fix a real issue  
- add legitimate academic value  

…it doesn’t belong here.
